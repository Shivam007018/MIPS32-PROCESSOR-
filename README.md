üß† MIPS32 Pipelined Processor (Verilog)
This project implements a 5-stage pipelined MIPS32 processor in Verilog, along with a testbench to simulate and verify its functionality. The processor supports basic arithmetic, memory operations, and branching, with a two-phase clock system (clk1 and clk2).

üìÅ Files

File Name	Description
mips32.v	Main processor module (pipe_MIPS32). Implements IF, ID, EX, MEM, WB stages.
mips32_test.v	Testbench to simulate the MIPS processor behavior.
mips32.vcd	Generated VCD (waveform) file from the testbench (if dumping is enabled).
üèóÔ∏è Pipeline Stages
IF (Instruction Fetch) ‚Äì Fetches instruction from memory. Supports branch redirection.

ID (Instruction Decode) ‚Äì Decodes opcode and reads registers.

EX (Execute) ‚Äì Executes ALU operations or calculates memory/branch addresses.

MEM (Memory Access) ‚Äì Loads or stores data to memory.

WB (Writeback) ‚Äì Writes results back to registers.

‚úÖ Initialization
Register bank is initialized with values 0 to 31.

Instruction memory is loaded with:

ADDI, LW, ADDI, SW, and HLT instructions.

Dummy instructions (OR R3, R3, R3) inserted for pipeline delays.

üßæ Sample Program:
assembly
Copy
Edit
ADDI  R1, R0, 120      // R1 = 120
LW    R2, 0(R1)        // R2 = Mem[120] = 80
ADDI  R2, R2, 45       // R2 = R2 + 45 = 125
SW    R2, 1(R1)        // Mem[121] = R2 = 125
HLT                   // Stop execution
üñ®Ô∏è Output:
After simulation:
